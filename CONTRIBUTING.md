## Coding conventions

Start reading the code and you'll get the hang of it.

  * Indent using two spaces.
  * Use template literals instead of double/single quotes (`` `string` ``, not `'string'` or `"string"`).
  * Don’t use parentheses when writing single parameter arrow functions.
  * Put spaces after list items and method parameters (`[1, 2, 3]`, not `[1,2,3]`), around operators (`x += 1`, not `x+=1`), and around fat arrows.
  * Put spaces between the `if` condition and its statement (`if (condition) {}`, not `if(condition){}`). Same thing for functions.
  * Add spaces inside curly braces (except templates).
  * Don’t forget your semicolons!
  * This is open source software. Consider the people who will read your code, and make it look nice for them.

Note: I've been unknowingly specifiying almost the same standards as [Airbnb's style guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript).

Thanks,
