# What makes this bot special
Honestly, nothing really. I just wanted to learn Discord's API as well as how to make a bot. The COVID-19 quarantine makes us do lots of stuff.

However, since I'm making a bot, might as well go all in. Here are some of the features I want the bot to have at some point:

- **Reaction roles** - Give roles to members based on the reaction they click on the message (Like the [Reaction Roles bot](https://droplet.gg/ReactionRoles))
- **Easily extendable command set** - An easy, hopefully automated, way to add commands to the bot. Ideally, the bot should detect all commands in a folder, and make them easily accessible to the help command.
- **Music player** - Like countless other bots, this bot should be able to play music from YouTube, SoundCloud and maybe other sources too. However, that is not in my priorities currently.
- **Search** - A Google search command could be pretty useful too, why not try it.

Now to contradicting myself, I would like this bot to be *as lightweight as possible*. For that, I'll try using the least dependencies possible to make everything work.

Currently, the help command only lists all available commands, however, I'd like it to also give more info about commands.
